* pico 8 tile-based rpg library

herein: a library of reusable classes and functions for a simple
tile-based rpg in pico 8. no licenses or anything. fork it, copy it,
clone it, use it, whatever. it's just a hobby to pass the time during
covid quarantine

** files included
*** ~character.p8~
constructor function to build a generic character. can be an npc, a
hero... hell, even a door or chest. has functions for movement and
drawing only. all other functionality is contained in child classes

*** ~hero.p8~
a child class of ~character.p8~ for player controlled characters ---
what you might call a hero. so far, only adds functionality for
player-controlled movement, but with plans to add things like
inventory, stats, etc
